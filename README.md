# 3DReconstruction_Face-reconstruction
High precision 3D face reconstruction based on depth camera

In recent years, facial reconstruction solutions have become increasingly mature, but often rely on precise hardware equipment and responsible algorithm design. However, in fact, not all users need such accurate facial models. Some people are eager to try new things, and some even don't want to see the bumpy details on their faces. Therefore, a fast, simple, and inexpensive 3D face reconstruction solution should be able to attract the attention of many consumers.
